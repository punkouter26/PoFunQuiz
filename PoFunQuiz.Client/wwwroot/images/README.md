# PWA Icon Instructions

The following placeholder icons are needed for the PWA functionality:

1. `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixel regular app icon
2. `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixel regular app icon
3. `icon-maskable-192.png` - 192x192 pixel maskable app icon (safe zone in center)
4. `icon-maskable-512.png` - 512x512 pixel maskable app icon (safe zone in center)

You can create these using any image editing tool. For a quick placeholder, you can use:
- Online tools like https://app-manifest.dev/
- Or convert your logo to the required sizes using https://realfavicongenerator.net/

For the PoFunQuiz app, use a design that reflects the quiz game theme with the color scheme matching the app's purple gradient (#6a11cb to #2575fc).

Place all these files in this directory to complete the PWA setup.
